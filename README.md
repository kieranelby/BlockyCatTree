# What is this

It is a program that generates a 3d-printable tree populated by lots of small cats. 45 cats to be precise.

# What does the tree look like

# Can I print it

Maybe, it worked for me on a Bambu P1S. Model available from https://makerworld.com/en/models/480868#profileId-392522 .

# How does it work

The tree is grown procedurally in voxels using a space colonization algorithm, then rendered to a triangle mesh.

To make the tree look more realistic, a strengthening algorithm is used based on weight and wind resistance.

The cats are added on high-up flat areas with space above.
